LESSONS LEARNED!!!
Must be using the same venv as where you installed geopandas, etc.!
Use where python to get path to python folder
In python folder, go to Lib->site-packages to find osgeo (if not there, then it was installed incorrectly?)
Open osgeo folder and copy path, add to environment variables
IF USING VENV IN VSCODE! ctrl+shift+P, Python: Select Interpreter, then select THE SAME VENV that you downloaded packages in
To download the packages, just do pip install and then the path to the wheel downloaded from github in downloads folder
Next time use conda...

### Changing working directory

### Checking for nans (not a numbers) and none

bad_counties = {}

# for year_major in bad_counties:
    


# print(males_se[2015].value_counts()) # -> equivalent to R table()

### Now the part where I learn plotly...
# print(majors[2015]['females_se'])
# print(majors[2015]['females_se'].value_counts())
